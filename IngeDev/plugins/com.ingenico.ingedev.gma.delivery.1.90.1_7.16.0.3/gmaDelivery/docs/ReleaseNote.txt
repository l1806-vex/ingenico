-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project:          GMA (Generic Master Application)

/******************* v1.90.1  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 September 24

WHAT'S NEW:
- The GSM status ticket now prints the current mode of the modem even if no
  operator is selected.
  
- It is now possible to automatically power off the terminal after a given
  time of inactivity (see the "Battery" menu). (Trackers #886/#919)
  
- The menu for black stripe and screen reduction is now hidden, but those
  options are still active by default on i8550 terminals.
  
BUG FIXES:
- The GMA would sometimes freeze after exiting from a plugin menu. This was
  caused by a full message queue. (Tracker#989)
  
- Various fixes regarding the selection for EMV and non-EMV cards. (Trackers #920/#932).
  In particular:
  - After offering the selection for an EMV application, problems would occur
    if the user chose no application and exited from the menu.
  - 2 bytes were missing from the buffer sent to an EMV application.
  
- When no SIM card is insert, the "missing SIM" icon was not displayed.
  (Tracker #983)
  
- On GSM terminals, there were problems with the sleep mode (GPRS not closed
  when going to sleep mode + terminal frozen when waking up from sleep mode).
  However, it is still not recommended to use sleep mode on GSM terminals.
  This is a partial fix for tracker #994.

/******************* v1.90.0_beta  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 September 9

WHAT'S NEW:
- Display reduction configuration and black stripe in the reduction area. Its 
  configuration is available in the 'Settings' plugin.  

BUG FIXES:
- GMA sometimes disconnects/reconnects to GPRS due to a missing checking 
  of the return value of the function that retuns the network status. (Tracker #980)
    
- When creating a custom GMA in IngeDev using the IngeDev add-on, the maintenance
  via socket would not work. This was caused by a missing registration of the
  "IP channel" plugin. (Tracker #975)
  
- In the PPP o/ RS232 options, the baud rate value was not saved if changed.
  (Tracker #976)

- The PPP parameters were not properly saved. (Tracker #985)

- Fix for a problem in the Maintenance process that would cause the GMA
  to freeze.

/******************* v1.85.4  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 July 16

WHAT'S NEW:
- GSM: added traces in case of errors when starting LNet. 

BUG FIXES:
- The GMA would sometimes ignore an operator and try to find another one,
  even after a succesful selection. (Trackers #973/#974)

/******************* v1.85.3  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 July 15

BUG FIXES:
- The auto-scheduling treatment for exhausted maintenance session was not working 
  properly.

- The function gmaInqGsmImeiImsi would return blank strings for IMEI and IMSI.
  (Trackers #961/#970)
  
- It was sometimes impossible to register to GSM at startup (Tracker #952).

/******************* v1.85.1_beta  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 June 30

WHAT'S NEW:

- SMF(Maintenance): Added auto-schedule treatment, when the maintenace session has failed.
  The new maintenance session will be scheduled for the next day.  

BUG FIXES:
- Sometimes the GMA would try to attach to GPRS when not registered on the GSM,
  which would cause some delay during in the switching process. (Tracker #969)

- The check for signal strength implemented for tracker #953 could cause trouble,
  such as constantly deattaching/reattaching to GPRS on the same operator (the
  problem is described in tracker #968). For safety, this check has been disabled
  for the moment.

/******************* v1.84.15  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 June 17

WHAT'S NEW:
- Added WPA support to gmaWiFiPlugin (Tracker#769). 

- "LAF" packages (type 20 to 31) are now removed from the delivered, because
  of issue on the "Settings/Security" menu reported in tracker #925.
  
- Added a new package '93' which is similar to 3, except that it prints
 "light" GSM/GPRS traces in a DFS file "log.txt".

- The GPRS Connection Timeout and GPRS Connection Retries are now configurable. They are
  available in the Advanced Options menu.

- If a crash occurs, all the GMA packages now print details on the crash
  in the file log.txt at next reboot.
  
- To improve the smart GPRS roaming, the GMA now sometimes uses the automatic mode
  of the module to select an operator.

BUG FIXES:
- On the i9530, SMC and MAG events were not received during the idle state.
  (Tracker #938)

- Card data entered manually va the "Manual Card Entry" plugin is now sent
  to the user application as ISO2 data instead of ISO1. (Tracker #927) 
  
- Fix: The Advanced Options menu wasn't be displayed in the GMA type 23 (Tracker#921).

- Fix: It wasn't possible to enter settings submenus or another submenu of other 
  plugins after manually entered a card. Added a hmi handle reset in the Manual Entry 
  plugin before returning to GMA (Tracker#926).

- Fix: Due to a API limitation, the gsmPlugin was having several problems for not 
  disconnecting GPRS in a properly sequence(Tracker#916).

- Fix: Now the "Enable PIN" menu of gsmPlugin is reflecting the last selected option
  as asked by the Tracker #924.

- Update: The default contrast value for i8550 terminals now is 30(Tracker#899).

- Fixed delay in the following items of PIN MENU of the gmaGsmPlugin: "PIN", 
  "Change PIN" and "Enab/Disab PIN"(Tracker#922). Additionally it was added 
  new improvement: A menu before each final processing asking the user for reboot.

- Fixed strange behavior by adding a PIN status checking if the plugin PIN status 
  is set to "Don't ask for PIN". This avoids desynchronization between the same 
  status in the SIM and in the plugin configuration.

- Fixed general wrong icon updating after SIM PIN Code related operations. For 
  example: after 3 PIN erronous retries, the PUK Required icon status wasn't 
  been displayed (just in the fourth retry).

- Fixed initial delay when operator selection is in automatic mode by checking 
  if the current mode is the same of the configured mode.
  
- The function 'smfCommConfigScheduleMnt' from the lib 'gmaLibPgComm' was
  requiring the function 'debugPrintf' from the lib 'DebugLib', and was
  printing traces. This has been fixed. (Tracker #933)  
  
- Fixed by workaround a reset provoked by a LNET bug during PPPos disconnection.
  (Tracker#929)
 
- Added a touchScreen calibration menu option in gmaPluginSettings (Tracker#936). 

- The gmaGSMPlugin was sometimes disconnecting/reconnecting to the GSM/GPRS network
  for no reason. (Tracker #943).

- In some cases the GSM/GPRS icons were not properly updated. (Tracker #939).

- The gmaGSMPlugin was sometimes getting stuck waiting for a NO_CARRIER event. 
  (Tracker#941).

- When the GMA was resetting the modem, it would not always wait until the
  modem is ready before selecting an operator. This would sometimes cause
  the modem to be blocked. (Tracker #954)

- In somes cases NO CARRIER events are not properly detected by the modem.
  This would cause subsequent GPRS communication to fail. A workaround
  is now made in the GMA for this issue. (Tracker #947) 
  
- The DNS addresses are now configurable. (Tracker#960)
  
- The GMA did not have a specific detection for GSM or GPRS deregistration.
  Therefore, losses of network were not consistently detected (when they were,
  it was mostly by chance).
  
- The GMA would try to attach to GPRS when no GSM network was registered.
  This would block the modem for a while and cause the switching process
  to take longer than it should.
  
- The GMA was sometimes sending commands without ensuring that the modem was
  available. This would sometimes cause the modem to block. (Trackers #944/#945).
  
- In some cases the modem can be stuck for a long time (failing GPRS selection,
  for instance). The GMA is now able to unblock the modem in those cases.
  
- The operator list was sometimes not refreshed when it should.

- When no operator was found, the GMA would wait for 6 minutes. This delay
  has been removed.

- When migrating from one GMA version to another, some of the configuration 
  parameters were sometimes reaffected with bad values (Detach, PDP Deactivate,
  GPRS disconnection timeout).

- When switching networks upon a GPRS deregistration, the GMA would sometimes try
  to reattach to the same operator 2 more times.
   
/******************* v1.83.6  ******************************************/
Date: 2009 January 26

WHAT'S NEW:
- Added menu in the GSM plugin allowing to choose the operator selection mode
  (Automatic, Manual, Manual/Auto, Smart). (Tracker #906)

- Added current operator Id to the ticket status in gmaGsmPlugin.

- Added "Low Battery" and "Wake Up" event treatment to gmaGsmPlugin to allow 
to turn phisical modem sleep and to turn it on in each event. 

- Improved treatment of GMA_POWER_RESTORE level indication (Tracker #904).

- Added current IP address to the ticket status in gmaGsmPlugin (Tracker #902)

BUG FIXES:
- The documentation for some options of the GSM plugin was missing. (Trackers
  #802 & #912).

- When importing the GMA delivery into IngeDev, the package type '0' would not
  appear in the "Download GMA" dialog box.

- Running the GMA with the manual card entry plugin in simulation mode would
  sometimes crash if there was no user application. (Tracker #917). 
  
- The manual card entry plugin would not close the HMI before sending a
  transaction message to the user application. Therefore, it was impossible for
  the user application to use the HMI after the user had entered card data
  manually. A new function (gmaCusConfig) was created to avoid Touch opening 
  (by gmaCusOpenHmiHandle) in internal plugins (who uses transferred hmi handle).
  (Tracker #909).
  
- The structure gmaStructMasterVersion_t sent with the message
  GMA_STRUCT_MASTER_VERSION was not filled properly. Now the version/release
  of the GMA is returned. (Tracker #911)

- Fixes on GSM configuration ticket:
  - The field "Software version" was incorrect
  - The field "Creation date" has been removed because it was not meaningful
  (Tracker #914)
  
- Fix: Now the Operator list is cleared when there is a succesful connection.
That avoids the GSM plugin to use a non-updated operator list to be used 
when the current GSM operator is not available anymore.

- Fix: Fixed gsmcGprsStart NULL pointer treatment: Now the static structure 
attributted in NULL pointer case has a hardcoded timeout value(Tracker #904);

- GMA would not handle operators with MNC on 3 digits. This fix needs an OS
  3.4.D or higher. (Tracker #905)
  
- Wasn't possible to access the 'Options' submenu in gmaGmsPlugin due to a 
LAF build configuration (Tracker #898). The 'Options' submenu uses direct hmi, 
not using LAF. Then it was been disabled in LAF build configurations.

- When turning the i8550 off, the GSM modem was not turned off, even though
  the option "Shutdown module" was on. (Tracker #897)
  Reason: the broadcast message sending wasn't specifying the 'Broadcast'
  logicalApp id. Rather sending the messages to all applications the function
  was sending the messages to a random logicalApp plugin id.
  This affected all the broadcast message sending in all plugins.  

/******************* v1.82.6  ******************************************/
Date: 2008 October 27
WHAT'S NEW:
- Improved the selection of the GSM/GPRS network.

BUG FIXES:
- In some cases the GSM on the 7910 might not work.
- The GSM/GPRS on Aqua was not working using an external
  modem. (Tracker #887)

/******************* v1.81.6  ******************************************/
Date: 2008 June 9

WHAT'S NEW:
- GMA menus can now be displayed on the i9530.

- New functions allowing to ask the GMA for opening/closing the GSM.
 (Tracker #822)
  
- Date/Time menu can now be protected by a password. (Tracker #808)

- Tracker #830: GMA can now support of OpenEstate applications in GMA menu.
  Now the function gmaMsgAddLogicalAppInfo, gmaMsgDelLogicalAppInfo and 
  gmaMsgAddLogicalAppStatus can be called from GMA_MSG_POWER_ON, 
  GMA_MSG_INIT_INTEGRITY_CHECK, GMA_MSG_STARTUP, GMA_MSG_TRANSACTION levels.

- GMA documentation has been reworked. The content of the documentation
  "Generic Master Application.pdf" has been updated and moved to gmaLib.chm.

BUG FIXES:
- It was impossible to do maintenance using a modem on V29. (Tracker #825)  

- smfCommConfigScheduleMnt was not working properly when the 'action' field
  was set to 2. (Tracker #872)

- Tracker #729: The GMA now automatically tries to reconnect to the GSM/GPRS
  network if the connection is lost.

- When the name of an application was exactly 16 characters long, this could
  cause errors in the "Startup App" functionality (blank application name in
  the menu, startup not working...). (Tracker #866)

- UI to enter IP address in SMF plugin is now the same as in the Ethernet plugin
  (delimited with dots). Consequently, this allows to enter the IP address on
  terminals where it was not possible: Aqua and i9530.
  It fixes trackers #785, #615 and #824 (partially).
  
- It is now possible to enter hyphen (-) and underscore (_) characters in the 
  following fields:
  - Host name for maintenance (when "socket" type is selected)
  - User name and password for PPP
  
- When entering the COM port for PPP, pressing "Del" does not erase the whole
  string anymore.

- It is now possible to enter special characters on the AQUA and i9530 for the
  following fields:
  - Host name for maintenance (when "socket" type is selected)
  - User name and password for PPP
  
- The message 'GMA_MNT_ACTION_AUTH' was sent only once (tracker #821).
  
- When the GMA was sending a GMA_MNT_ACTION_xx message, it would not close
  the HMI handle, therefore preventing applications to use the HMI (tracker
  #821).

/******************* v1.80.2  ******************************************/
Date: 2008 February 19

WHAT'S NEW:
- Tracker #762:
  After a unsuccessful maintenance session the failure reason is now printed.
  
- Tracker #761:
  The message asking for cancelling maintenance now disappears after a specific
  timeout. 
- Trackers #740, #737 and #542
	Add PPP plug-in. Connection over modem (PSTN) and serial.

BUG FIXES:
- Tracker #813:
  Impossible to link with both Ethernet and WiFi plugins in ARM SDT because
  of duplicated global variable "netNiConfig".
  
- Tracker #796:
  Radio menu items should start with a capital letter.
  
- Tracker #786:
  Mag data format different between real card and manually entered data.
  
- Tracker #771:
  Terminal would freeze when setting special values for sleep mode in 
  configuration file.
 
- Correct a bug in the custom part. If a plug-in set a key to have the
  default behavior (that is send a query to all applications asking with
  application should treat the key) if more then one application answer
  the query message with the same acceptance level the menu to select
  the applications is not shown.
  
- Trackers #623, #770 and #798
  Add some more characters in the edition of some fields, (SSID, User, APN)
  
- Fixed tracker #809:
  During a maintenance session, the GMA now displays the connection try number.

- Bug tracker 547 -> Unable to enter apn, user name & password in
  symbolic form in the GPRS configuration menu.
- Bug tracker 560 -> SMF plug-in failed to populate with call schedule from 
  IngEstate.
- Add support for cancelling the maintenance session, in terminals with or
  without keyboard
- In the power on message the GMA now sends the application ID of the application.
- When a plugin receives a message from a application the field appId is now
  filled correctly.
- Bug tracker 579: the GMA simulation now has the ethernet plug-in.
- Improve the gmaLib documentation with more information with the
  logicalId to use when no logical application was added.
- When the application didn't add a logical application in
  the answer to the power on, a logical application is
  automatically added with 0xFF but this logicalId 0xFF
  makes the menu resource not be displayed. Now it is
  fixed in this version and the menu resource will be displayed
  in this case.
- improve the documentation of the function gmaCstMsgResourceMenuStatus
- Bug tracker 581: Incorrect documentation for function gmaMsgEndEncode
- Correct the function gmaPgMsgCloseComm to close the queue when there
  is no more open channels. It can cause problems with the gclPgSup, when
  the taskId number of the GCL change from one connection to another.
- Internal changes to make it works on the I8550MHC032A 
  (correct the internal behaviour).
- Bug tracker 592: Correct the GSM plug-in, there is a bug that could 
  make the terminal crash in the treatment of the powerlevel message.
- Put a protection in the function gmaMsgRead. It crashed when used without a
  prior call to gmaMsgDecode, now it returns an error.
- The menuLib had dependency on the gmaCustomLib. The dependency was removed.
- In case of terminal I3070 the settings plug-in change the behaviour of the
  keys HMI_KEY_F6 and HMI_KEY_F9 to start the plug-in menu.
