<h2>Seamless Deployment</h2>
From integration into the user's environment, through support for 
bespoke applications development to risk assessment, cost control and 
reporting, Ingenico’s experienced project management capabilities are 
integral to the success of its projects. Comprising technical experts, 
systems architects and consultants, the team supports the client through
 every stage of the deployment, guaranteeing its successful completion –
 on time and on budget.<br>
<h2>Proven Service Management</h2>
The management of customer data supported by today's POS systems is a 
complex business. Maintaining a large number of services - bespoke or 
off-the-shelf, providing guaranteed security and a 24/7 uninterrupted 
service adds further stress. Ingenico takes this pain away. Ingenico’s 
Incendo Online gateway guarantees end-to-end control of the entire 
application, providing complete data visibility, slashing total cost of 
ownership and assuring delivery from outlet to central server - first 
time, every time.<br>
<h2>Assured Lifecycle Security</h2>

service providers, banks and merchants to go beyond payment, extending 
the benefits of the web to deliver a unique set of user-friendly 
services that support increased customer loyalty and generate 
incremental revenues. Ingenico's fully secured value added services 
infrastructure provides certified PCI DSS as standard to assure every 
transaction and a powerful gateway to integrate value added applications
 with POS estates.<br>
<h2>Global Reach, Local Knowledge</h2>

hspace="10" vspace="5">Developing and deploying innovative new payment 
options and services across dispersed terminal assets, in multiple 
locations, is a challenge. It is one that demands significant global 
expertise combined with indepth knowledge of domestic markets. Ingenico 
is the only provider with the scale to meet this challenge. The Incendo 
Online platform combines the widest possible global coverage - 15 
million terminals in more than 120 countries - with the most 
comprehensive local knowledge, massively reducing the cost and 
complexity of global application deployment and management.<br> </div>
