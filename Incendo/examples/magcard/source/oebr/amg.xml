    It is an example file for demonstrate PAM functionality simulation in oebr.

    This file contains the list of replies (amgReceive) for amgSend request
    of PAM, which are accessible to simulator user.

    This file should be placed into common directory of oebr simulator.

    User should specify:
        - TML screen;
        - message lists for screen.

    For each screen may be defined own message list.
    If there are not defined some screens or an ampty message list defined
    for some screen it means no messages will be received for that screens.

    For each screen element should be defined screen name (id).
    For each message element should be defined timeout (-1 means infinite timeout) in 10ms.

    Each message contains variable list (var elements). For each var element
    should be defined name, type and value.
    Var element supports "string", "integer", "date" and "opaque" types.
    Date type format is "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss", where DD - day (00-31), MM - month (00-12),
    YYYY - year (for example, 2006), hh - hous (00-23), mm - minutes (00-59) and
    ss - seconds (00-59). For example, "2005-12-01 22:05:36".
    Opaque stores in base64 encoding string (for example,
    "ABCXWZ01237890abcdefxyz+/ABC").
