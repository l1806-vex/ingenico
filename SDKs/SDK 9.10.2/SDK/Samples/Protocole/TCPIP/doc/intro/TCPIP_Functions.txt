* - <b>Network Info</b> (\ref DFU_ComNetInfoDisplay )
* - <b>HTTP Server</b> ( \ref DFU_ComServerStart )
* - <b>HTTP Client</b> ( \ref DFU_ComClientConnect )
*
* \section tcpsecf1 Network Info
*
* Displays the Ethernet parameters of the terminal. The terminal's IP address will be displayed followed by the subnet mask.
* 
* \b Note: On products that have an Ethernet interface through a Bluetooth base ( EFT930, iWL2XX) it returns the local Ethernet interface's parameters and not the ones from the base's interface.
* 
* \section tcpsecf2 HTTP Server
* 
* Selecting this item from the menu will start a socket server.
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Create a listening socket  ( \ref _DFU_ComStart ) 
* - Bind/assign a name to a socket  ( \ref _DFU_ComSetServer )
* - Listens to incoming connections. Up to eight (8) simultaneous connections can be handled by the server. 
* - Accept Incoming connection
* - Receives messages from the socket (from the client socket)
* - Transmit messages to another socket (to the client socket)

* 
* \section tcpsecf3 HTTP Client
* 
* Selecting this item from the menu will start a socket client.
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Create a socket to be used to connect to a server. ( \ref _DFU_ComStart )
* - Set the address and port of the server to connect to ( \ref _DFU_ComSetClient )
* - Connect to a socket server ( \ref _DFU_ComConnect )
* - Transmit an HTTP request message to the server
* - Waits and receives a response message from the server
