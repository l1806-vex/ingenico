 /** \page Functions Main Functions

* The following are the main functionalities of the SSL Sample Application: 
*
* - \b Profiles - Add (\ref FUN_SslProfileAdd), Delete ( \ref FUN_SslProfileDelete ) and List ( \ref FUN_SslProfileListPrint )
* - \b Connection ( \ref FUN_SslConnectionTest )
* - \b Config ( \ref FLOW_ParamConfigSSLProcess )
*
* \section sslsecf1 Profiles 
*
* Allows the user to Add, Delete and List (Print) available profiles
* 
* \b Add 
* 
* This is the first step that a user must execute. A profile must be added in order to have a successful loading of profile during Config and Connection. It creates a new profile configured for mutual authentication.
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Create a new SSL Profile (SSL_NewProfile)
* - Sets the SSL protocol used by the SSL Profile (SSL_ProfileSetProtocol)
* - Sets the mask of ciphers and export modes supported by the profile (SSL_ProfileSetCipher)
* - Sets the private key file used by the SSL profile (SSL_ProfileSetKeyFile )
* - Sets the certificate file used by the ssl profile (SSL_ProfileSetCertificateFile)
* - Adds a CA or CRL to a profile (SSL_ProfileAddCertificateCA)
* - Saves an SSL profile (SSL_SaveProfile)
* - Unloads an SSL profile (SSL_UnloadProfile )
* 
* \b Delete 
* 
* Allows the user to delete a profile in the terminal.
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Deletes an SSL profile in the SSL saved list (SSL_DeleteProfile)
* 
* \b List 
* 
* Prints each profile that has been created. For each profile, it prints information 
about its certificates : the validity period, the common name (CN)...
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Prints the name of the file which contains the client X509 certificate (SSL_ProfileGetCertificateFile)
* - Prints the name of the CA certificate file (SSL_ProfileGetCAFile)
* 
* \section sslsecf2 Connection
* 
* Selecting this item from the menu will start an SSL connection.
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Start SSL (DFU_StartSsl) 
* - Load the profile that was selected during config (SSL_LoadProfile)
* - Connects SSL (DFU_ConnectSSL) 
* - Creates an SSL Structure (SSL_New)
* - Connect to the Server (SSL_Connect)
* - Disconnects SSL  (DFU_DisconnectSsl)
* - Closes an SSL Connection (SSL_Disconnect)
* - Stop SSL (DFU_StopSsl)
* - Free an allocated SSL Structure (SSL_Free)
* 
* \section sslsecf3 Configure
* 
* Selecting this item from the menu will allow the user to configure host name, port number and profile to be used.
* 
* Function Tasks:
* - Prompts user to enter Host Name or Host Address to connect to. ( \ref _FUN_ConfigStateSSLServerAddressGet )
* - Prompts user to enter Port Number to connect to ( \ref _FUN_ConfigStateSSLServerPortGet )
* - Prompts user to select profile to be used from list. ( \ref _FUN_ConfigStateSSLProfileGet )
